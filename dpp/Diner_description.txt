Description of the problem

Five philosophers sit around a circular table. Each philosopher spends
his life alternatively thinking and eating. In the centre of the table
is a large plate of noodles. A philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat
a helping of noodles. Unfortunately, as philosophy is not as well paid
as computing, the philosophers can only afford five chopsticks. One chopstick
is placed between each pair of philosophers and they agree that each will
only use the chopstick to his immediate right and left. The slider in the
applet below controls the amount of time that a philosopher spends eating
and thinking. Philosophers are depicted in yellow when they are thinking,
blue when hungry and green when eating.
