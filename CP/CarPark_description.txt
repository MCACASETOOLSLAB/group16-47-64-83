Cars enter through the WEST gate and leave through the EAST gate.
The CARPARK can hold a maximum of  N = 4 cars.
When CARPARK is full then cars are not permitted to enter until a car leaves
creating a space. As is the nature of carparks, cars try to enter at twice the rate that
they leave. The program uses guarded communication. Arrival events are not accepted
when the carpark is full.
